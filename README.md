Objective of the paper is to provide an efficient algorithm for offloading the tasks which are computationally intensive from the Edge Devices to the Fog Nodes using Matching Theory. It aims to reduce the time complexity under the assumption that the EDs will select an appropriate FN to offload its computationally intensive task.
